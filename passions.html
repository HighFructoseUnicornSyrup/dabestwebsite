                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, the Orks stand as one of the most numerous and savage races in the galaxy. These violent, dumb, and warlike creatures live only for combat and violence, their insatiable thirst for battle drives them to wage war against all other species they encounter, and sometimes themselves.</p>

                <h2>Physiology</h2>
                <p>Orks are a large, muscular race of humanoid creatures, ranging from a few meters tall to towering behemoths in the Warlords. Their bodies are covered in thick, green skin and toughened muscle, granting them incredible durability and resilience. Orks possess an amazing regenerative ability, allowing them to recover from injuries that would be fatal to other species.</p>
                <p>Orks are biologically engineered to be incredibly hardy and resilient, able to survive in the harshest environments and recover from wounds that would kill other races. They are also incredibly long-lived, with some Orks living for hundreds of years.</p>

                <h2>"Society" and Culture</h2>
                <p>Ork society is built entirely around warfare and violence. They are organized into massive, nomadic hordes known as Waaaghs, led by the strongest and most vicious Orks, called Warbosses. Orks live for combat and are driven by an innate desire to fight and conquer, a phenomenon they call the "WAAAGH!" – a psychic field that amplifies their aggression and strength.</p>
                <p>Despite vastly outnumbering all other species in the galaxy, with the exception of the Tyranids, Ork civilizations are short lived as rampant and bloody infighting is the norm.</p>
                <p>Ork society is highly stratified, with the strongest and most aggressive Orks rising to positions of power. Because of this, weaker Orks serve as cannon fodder for the stronger ones.</p>
                <p>Ork religion is very simple. THey believe in two larger Orks that are the biggest orks. Gork and Mork. Gork is brutal but cutting; and Mork is cunning, but brutal/</p>

                <h2>Reproduction and Evolution</h2>
                <p>Orks have a unique reproductive cycle that involves the release of microscopic spores. These spores can lie dormant for centuries on planets, waiting for the right conditions to germinate and grow into fully-fledged Orks. This process is accelerated by the presence of other Orks and the psychic energy generated by the WAAAGH! field.</p>
                <p>The creators of the Ork species implemented a genetic code called the techno gene which develops as orks grow. The techno gene enables orks to intuitively know how to fight, speak Ork, and operate weapons. The techno gene is how the surgerons and mechanics of <Obj></Obj>rk society gain their knowledge and skills.</p>

                <h2>Weapons and Technology</h2>
                <p>Orks are masters of improvised and ramshackle technology, cobbling together weapons and vehicles from scavenged materials and junk. Their weapons range from primitive clubs and axes to powerful shootas and mechanized walkers.</p>
                <p>One of the most iconic Ork weapons is the Slugga, a crude but powerful ballistic weapon that fires solid ammunition. Orks also make use of a variety of melee weapons, including the iconic Choppa – a brutal, serrated blade designed for close-quarters combat.</p>
                <p>Ork vehicles are equally ramshackle and deadly, ranging from the fast and agile Warbikes to the massive, heavily-armored Battlewagons and Gorkanauts. These vehicles are often covered in spikes, blades, and other decorations, reflecting the Orks' love for violence and mayhem.</p>
